/*

    Event timeout

    This is for the user-mode TCP stack. We need to mark timeouts in the
    future when we'll re-visit a connection/tcb. For example, when we
    send a packet, we need to resend it in the future in case we don't
    get a response.

    This design creates a large "ring" of timeouts, and then cycles
    again and again through the ring. This is a fairly high granularity,
    just has hundreds, thousands, or 10 thousand entries per second.
    (I keep adjusting the granularity up and down). Not that at any
    slot in the ring, there may be entries from the far future.

    NOTE: a big feature of this system is that the structure that tracks
    the timeout is actually held within the TCB structure. In other
    words, each TCB can have one-and-only-one timeout.

    NOTE: a recurring bug is that the TCP code removes a TCB from the
    timeout ring and forgets to put it back somewhere else. Since the
    TCB is cleaned up on a timeout, such TCBs never get cleaned up,
    leading to a memory leak. I keep fixing this bug, then changing the
    code and causing the bug to come back again.
