# How can I add my IP address to an exclude list so that people stop scanning me?

# Question

I hate everyone probing me all the time and want them to stop.
How can I add my IP address ranges to an exclude list?

# Answer

You can't.

First of all, nobody is going to pay attention to a sample exclude list
within this project. Sure, I can add IP addresses to the list, but that
won't help you.

Second, there's no way I can confirm who you are. So I can't simply
add to an exclude list just because you ask.

Thirdly, it'll just make you more of a target, as smart hackers know to
use the exclude-list as one of their first include-lists, as it marks
people who have something to hide.

Fourthly, and most importantly, it's Wrong Think on how to manage your
network.
